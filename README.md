[![Marketplace](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare.svg?label=marketplace&style=flat-square&color=AF1BB2&labelColor=5E1BB2)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
[![Installs](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs-short/MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare.svg?style=flat-square&color=8F1BB2&labelColor=5E1BB2)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
[![Rating](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/rating-short/MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare.svg?style=flat-square&color=8F1BB2&labelColor=5E1BB2)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)

Live Share makes it easy to code with your team by letting you collaboratively edit, debug, and fix code in real-time without leaving the comfort of your own VS Code setup.

Simply click the Live Share button in the status bar, copy the session URL, and send it to your team. Anyone with access to the link can automatically join your coding session from their own code editor. 

**Why it's great for remote work:** Teams that code together, stick together. Collaborative coding with Live Share can help remote developers debug faster, solve problems more effectively, and pair program with ease.

Pomodoro Timer is a simple Pomodoro timer that shows in the status bar. Click the start button to begin a 25-minute session. After the allotted time has elapsed, Pomodoro Timer will remind you to take a short break. 

The concept behind the Pomodoro Technique is quite simple: focus on a single task for 25 minutes, followed by a 5 minute break. Every fourth break will be a bit longer, at 15 minutes. Following the pomodoro pattern breaks your day into 130-minute intervals. Focused blocks of time encourage effective unitasking, rather than unproductive multitasking. 

**Why it's great for remote work:** When working remotely, you can add structure to your schedule by carving out time for focused work, interspersed with breaks. Pomodoro Timer is great for creating a productive and healthy coding routine, especially when working from home.
